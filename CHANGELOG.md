# CHANGELOG
Details of changes and the dates on which they occurred.

## 19.07.2019
- Fully redeveloped the website using a [different library](https://github.com/rohanchandra/javascript-terminal) instead of XtermJS
    - XtermJS was a library meant to connect to a bash shell or something underneath, wasn't really designed for the use case.
    - This new library comes with some command emulation built in
    - It's also made my bundle size smaller!
    - And the website uses normal HTML to render output and gather input, meaning it's actually usable on mobile!

## 16.07.2019
- Fully deployed basic terminal website
    - Mobile support is all but non-existant, but it's a start!
