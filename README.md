# freyama.de
Now powered by `fresh`, my own little terminal clone.

There's still quite a lot to do with the interactive version, but I'm really enjoying working on this website.

This is very much a WIP, but it's coming along quite quickly.

## Plans
- Probably my biggest plan for this website is to install a drizzle REPL into it, when I get drizzle to the stage of having a WASM playground.

## TODOs
- Tab autocompletion
- `*` expansion
- More commands
