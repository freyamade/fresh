<p>An exploration into LangChain/LangGraph and LLM powered bot software using my own website as a basis.</p>
<p>It is a very simple Discord Bot that uses LangChain on top of VertexAI to take plain-english requests from people and parses data from the SavageAim API to answer them.</p>
<p>As a brief foray into the world of LangChain and tool-calling, it is extremely basic, but it's public nonetheless!</p>
