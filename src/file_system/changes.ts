<p><span class="green">-</span> Fully redeveloped the website using a different library instead of XtermJS.</p>
<p><span class="green">-</span> XtermJS was a library meant to connect to a bash shell or something underneath, wasn't really designed for the use case.</p>
<p><span class="green">-</span> This new library comes with some command emulation built in.</p>
<p><span class="green">-</span> It's also made my bundle size smaller!</p>
<p><span class="green">-</span> And the website uses normal HTML to render output and gather input, meaning it's actually usable on mobile!</p>`
